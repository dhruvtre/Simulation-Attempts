# Simulation-Attempts

A collection of minimal, concept-driven simulations exploring emergent behavior in artificial environments.

* ```adaptive-agent-growth.ipynb``` - This notebook models agent-based growth and movement on a 2D grid, inspired by Richard Dawkins' *The Blind Watchmaker*.  Agents evolve over generations using simple rules for size and direction, with movement choices biased by prior actions to simulate adaptive dynamics.
